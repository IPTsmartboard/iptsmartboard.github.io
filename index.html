          The Institute of Interfaces and Particle Technology is part of the Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering (CBI) within the Faculty of Engineering at the Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg (FAU).
<br><br>Research at the Institute of Interfaces and Particle Technology broadly focusses on the development of particle systems along the entire process chain – from tailored polymer and particle syntheses, via surface modification and functionalization, to the development self-assembled structures and the exploration of functional, macroscopic materials properties based on these systems.
<br><br>Of central importance is the detailed characterization of particles, surfaces and interfaces in all facets – from multidimensional size and shape analyses, via the physicochemical properties of ligand-spheres and surfaces and microscopy methods to investigate surface topographies and structural features across the scales – to resulting macroscopic properties. This broad portfolio of characterization methods has been institutionalized as a core facility FPS  and is available to interested external researchers and companies.
<br><br>The Institute of Interfaces and Particle Technology currently hosts four research groups that cover a wide range of interdisciplinary research topics.
